# HammerSpoon config

This repository contains my [hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/)
configuration.

It is wired up via a symlink from my home directory, but if you want to use, it
you can via the following:

    # replace ~/code/personal/hammerspoon with the path to your 
    # clone of this repository.
    ln -s ~/code/personal/hammerspoon ~/.hammerspoon

In order to bootstrap the installation, you'll need to manually download the
[SpoonInstall](https://www.hammerspoon.org/Spoons/SpoonInstall.html) spoon and
put it in the [Spoons](./Spoons) directory.
